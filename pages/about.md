I am a Network Engineer with a decade plus experience designing, implementating, and administering network solutions. I hold multiple certifications from vendors such as Cisco, Fortinet, AWS, and  Google.

The name of this blog makes a reference to J.R.R. Tolkien's world (Valar) and another realm I enjoy: networking (net). 

Look around this blog and if you feel like it, leave any kind of feedback.

Two quotes I like:

*"What you aim at determines what you see." - Jordan Peterson*

*"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way." - Marcus Aurelius*
