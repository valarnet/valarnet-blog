My name is Ash. I am a Network Engineer experienced in designing, implementing, and administering network solutions. I hold multiple certifications from vendors such as Cisco, Fortinet, AWS, and  Google. - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashenafi-w-bekele-4938a424" target="_blank">My LinkedIn Profile</a>

The name of this blog is a combination of Tolkien's world (Valar) and another realm I enjoy: networking (net).
