I am a Network Engineer with 10+ years of experience in design, implementation, and administration of network solutions. I hold a variety of certifications from many vendors such as Cisco, Fortinet, AWS, and  Google.

The name of this blog makes a reference to J.R.R. Tolkien (Valar) and another realm I love: networking (net). 

Look around this blog and if you feel like it, leave any kind of feedback.
