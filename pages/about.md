I am a Network Engineer with 10+ years of experience in design, implementation, and administration of network solutions. I hold a variety of certifications from many vendors such as Cisco, Fortinet, AWS, and  Google.

The name of this blog makes a reference to J.R.R. Tolkien (Valar) and another realm I love: networking (net). I’ve been obsessed with Tolkien’s world-building genius ever since I stumbled upon it by chance decades ago. Thus kicking off my journey with the events of the Third Age and working my way to the preceding ages.

Look around this blog and if you feel like it, give me feedback. Let me know what helps, what isn’t right (typos, corrections, missed details, etc.)
